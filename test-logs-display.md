# Testing the Logs Display

## Current Status:
✅ Testing mode is ON (orange indicator visible)
✅ App is making HTTP requests to middleware
✅ UI is properly integrated

## Issue:
❌ "Error Loading Logs" - middleware not running with testing mode

## Solution:
Start the middleware with testing mode enabled

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Open terminal and navigate to project**
2. **Set testing mode environment variable**
3. **Start middleware**
4. **Generate some test logs**
5. **See real-time logs in app**

## Commands:
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/rexliu/shroudinger

# Export testing mode
export SHROUDINGER_TESTING=true

# Start middleware
cd middleware && go run ./cmd/middleware
```

## Expected Result:
- Real log entries appear in the app interface
- Auto-refresh shows new logs every 2-3 seconds
- Terminal logs match app display
