# DNS Protection Toggle Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The DNS Protection toggle was turning OFF immediately after being turned ON, with connection refused errors in the debug console.

## Root Causes
1. **Service State Management**: The `startServices()` function was setting `servicesRunning = true` immediately, then only reverting to `false` if services failed to start. This caused the UI to show "ON" briefly before reverting to "OFF".
2. **Sandboxed App Path Issue**: The app was trying to find the project at `/Users/rexliu/Library/Containers/blubberstudios.Shroudinger/Data/shroudinger` instead of the actual project location at `/Users/rexliu/shroudinger`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Fixed the timing issue where `servicesRunning` was set to `true` before services actually started
- Now `servicesRunning` is only set to `true` after confirming all services are running
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track the startup process

### 2. Fixed Project Path Resolution
- Updated `getProjectRoot()` function to handle sandboxed app environment
- Uses `NSString(string: "~").expandingTildeInPath` to get actual user home directory
- Properly resolves to `/Users/rexliu/shroudinger` instead of sandboxed path

### 3. Improved Service Startup Process
- Added detailed logging to show:
  - Project root path resolution
  - Script path validation
  - Environment variable setup
  - Script execution results
  - Individual service health status

### 4. Files Modified
- **`frontend/Shroudinger/Shroudinger/SettingsManager.swift`**: Enhanced `startServices()` function with better error handling, logging, and path resolution
- **Created `logs/` directory**: Required for service startup script to function properly

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build the app**: The app should already be built with the fixes
2. **Enable Testing Logs**: In the app's Development Tools section, turn ON "Testing Logs"
3. **Test the toggle**: 
   - Turn OFF the DNS Protection toggle (if it's ON)
   - Turn ON the DNS Protection toggle
   - Watch the debug console for detailed startup logs

## Expected Behavior
- Toggle should stay ON after being clicked
- Services should start successfully
- Testing logs should show real-time middleware activity
- Debug console should show startup progress with emojis (üöÄ, üîç, üìã, etc.)

## Debug Console Output
You should see output like:
```
üöÄ Starting services...
üîç Project root: /Users/rexliu/shroudinger
üîç Script path: /Users/rexliu/shroudinger/scripts/start-services.sh
üîç Environment: ["SHROUDINGER_TESTING": "true"]
üìã Script result - success: true, error: none
‚è≥ Waiting for services to start...
‚úÖ All services started successfully
```

## If Issues Persist
1. Check that the `scripts/start-services.sh` file is executable
2. Verify that Go is installed and available in PATH
3. Check that no other processes are using ports 8080, 8081, 8082, 8083

## Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Stop all services
./scripts/stop-services.sh

# Start services manually with testing mode
SHROUDINGER_TESTING=true ./scripts/start-services.sh

# Check service health
curl -s http://localhost:8083/health
curl -s http://localhost:8083/testing/logs
```

The fix ensures that the toggle accurately reflects the actual service state and provides detailed debugging information for troubleshooting.
