# Testing Toggle Integration

## What I've Implemented:

### 1. **Connected the Toggle to Services**
- Main DNS Protection toggle now calls `startServices()` and `stopServices()`
- Services start with testing mode if "Testing Logs" is enabled
- Services stop completely when toggle is OFF

### 2. **Updated Logging Views**
- **When Services OFF**: Shows "Services Not Running" message
- **When Services ON**: Shows real-time logs
- **Auto-refresh**: Only works when services are running
- **Clean State**: Logs clear when services stop

### 3. **Service State Management**
- Services respect the `testingLogsEnabled` setting
- Environment variable `SHROUDINGER_TESTING=true` set when needed
- Proper start/stop scripts are called

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Make sure "Testing Logs" is enabled** in Development Tools
3. **Toggle DNS Protection OFF** - should see:
   - "Services Not Running" in Testing Logs window
   - "Services not running" in compact view
   - No HTTP requests in terminal
4. **Toggle DNS Protection ON** - should see:
   - Services start with testing mode
   - Real-time logs appear
   - HTTP requests resume in terminal
5. **Toggle DNS Protection OFF again** - should see:
   - Services stop
   - Logs clear
   - HTTP requests stop

## Expected Behavior:
- **Toggle ON**: Services start → Logs appear → Auto-refresh works
- **Toggle OFF**: Services stop → Logs clear → Auto-refresh stops
- **Testing Mode**: Only enabled when "Testing Logs" is ON

## Commands to Test Manually:
```bash
# Check if services are running
curl -s http://localhost:8083/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
curl -s http://localhost:8081/health
curl -s http://localhost:8082/health

# Should return connection errors when toggle is OFF
# Should return 200 OK when toggle is ON
```
