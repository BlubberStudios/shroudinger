# Testing Instructions

## To Test the Testing Logs Sidebar:

1. **Build and run the app** in Xcode
2. **Go to Overview section**
3. **Look for "Development Tools" card**
4. **Toggle "Testing Logs" ON**
5. **Check the sidebar** - you should now see "Testing Logs" appear
6. **Click on "Testing Logs"** in the sidebar
7. **You should see** the full testing logs window

## Debug Information Added:
- Orange debug text "ðŸ§ª Testing Mode: ON" appears when testing is enabled
- Orange dot appears next to "Testing Logs" in sidebar
- Console print when toggle changes

## If Still Not Working:
The issue might be that the UserDefaults isn't properly saving/loading. Try:
1. Quit and restart the app
2. Check the console for the debug print
3. Look for the orange debug indicators

## Expected Behavior:
- **Toggle OFF**: Only "Overview", "DNS Settings", "Activity Logs" in sidebar
- **Toggle ON**: All above PLUS "Testing Logs" in sidebar
