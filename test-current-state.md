# Current State Test

## What should happen now:

1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Go to Overview** (you're already there)
3. **Scroll down** - you should see "Development Tools" section right after "Protection Statistics"
4. **Toggle "Testing Logs" ON**
5. **Check sidebar** - "Testing Logs" should appear with orange dot
6. **Optional**: Toggle "Show in Overview" to see logs in main view

## Debug indicators to look for:
- Orange text "ðŸ§ª Testing Mode: ON" in sidebar
- Orange dot next to "Testing Logs" in sidebar  
- Console message: "ðŸ§ª Testing logs enabled changed to: true"

## If still not working:
Check the console for any Swift errors or missing files.

## Next steps:
1. Test the toggle functionality
2. Verify sidebar updates
3. Test the full logs window
4. Test service startup with testing mode
