# What tech stack - frameworks, developer tools, sdks, packages, libraries, extensions, languages or whatever should we use for the UI, the app logic and the backend?

TLDR:
For a macOS DNS privacy app like "Shroudinger," you want a tech stack that’s modern, native, and future-proof. Go all-in on Swift and Apple frameworks for the frontend and app logic, and leverage Apple’s Network Extension APIs for system-level DNS interception. Use proven open-source libraries for blocklist parsing and DNS protocol support. Here’s your blueprint—Scott Galloway style: fast, secure, and built to scale.

# Tech Stack Overview for "Shroudinger"

## 1. User Interface (UI)

**Goal:** Native, responsive, and accessible macOS experience—menu bar, settings, and real-time status.

- **Language:** Swift 5.9+ (for modern concurrency and performance)
- **Frameworks:**
    - **SwiftUI:** Declarative UI, seamless macOS integration, supports dark mode and accessibility
    - **AppKit:** For advanced macOS controls and legacy compatibility
    - **MenuBarExtra (macOS 13+):** For menu bar integration
    - **Combine:** Reactive programming for UI state management
- **Developer Tools:**
    - Xcode 15+ (IDE, Interface Builder, Swift Package Manager)
    - Instruments (for UI performance profiling)
- **Accessibility:** VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and localization support


## 2. App Logic (Core Engine)

**Goal:** High-performance DNS filtering, blocklist management, encrypted DNS support.

- **Language:** Swift (with possible C/C++ interop for performance-critical code)
- **Frameworks \& APIs:**
    - **NetworkExtension:** For system-wide DNS interception
        - **NEDNSProxyProvider:** Core of DNS proxy/filtering
        - **NEAppProxyProvider:** (if you want to expand to VPN-level filtering)
    - **Network.framework:** For low-level networking and encrypted DNS (DoT, DoH, DoQ)
    - **Foundation:** For data handling, JSON/XML parsing, URLSession for blocklist downloads
- **Libraries/Packages:**
    - **Trie/Bloom Filter Implementations:** For ultra-fast domain matching (e.g., open-source Swift tries or custom)
    - **Yams or SwiftYAML:** For YAML blocklist parsing (if needed)
    - **CryptoKit:** For cryptographic operations and certificate validation
    - **Swift Argument Parser:** If you add CLI utilities
- **Testing:**
    - XCTest/XCUITest for unit and UI tests


## 3. Backend (Blocklist \& Update Service)

**Goal:** Efficiently fetch, parse, and merge remote blocklists; provide update scheduling.

- **Language:** Swift (for in-app logic), Python or Go (optional, for external blocklist aggregation scripts)
- **Frameworks/Tools:**
    - **URLSession:** For HTTP(S) downloads of blocklists
    - **Combine:** For async blocklist updates and notifications
    - **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD):** For background processing
    - **Launch Agents/Daemons:** For scheduled background updates (if needed)
- **External Services:**
    - **GitHub Releases, S3, or custom server:** For hosting blocklist updates
    - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or Fastlane for automated builds and notarization


## 4. Security \& Distribution

- **Code Signing:** Apple Developer ID, App Sandbox, Hardened Runtime
- **Entitlements:** Network Extension, App Sandbox, System Extension (if needed)
- **Notarization:** Required for distribution outside the Mac App Store
- **User Guidance:** Custom onboarding for extension approval


## 5. Optional: Cross-Platform or Advanced Features

- **Rust or Go:** For performance-critical DNS code, compiled as Swift-compatible libraries
- **Electron or Tauri:** Only if you want a cross-platform UI (not recommended for native macOS experience)
- **Open Source DNS Libraries:** For advanced DNS protocol support (e.g., getdns, dnscrypt-proxy, or custom Swift wrappers)


# Tech Stack Table

| Layer | Language | Frameworks/SDKs | Packages/Libraries | Tools |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| UI | Swift | SwiftUI, AppKit, Combine | MenuBarExtra | Xcode, Instruments |
| App Logic | Swift, C/C++ | NetworkExtension, Network | Trie/Bloom, CryptoKit, Yams | XCTest, Swift Package Manager |
| Backend | Swift, Python | URLSession, GCD, Combine | SwiftYAML, custom scripts | GitHub Actions, Fastlane |
| Security | — | App Sandbox, Network Extension | — | Code Signing, Notarization |

# Bottom Line

Go full native: Swift for everything, Apple frameworks for system integration, and open-source libraries for DNS and blocklist performance. Avoid cross-platform shortcuts—this is a power user’s tool, and it should feel like it. Build fast, secure, and with total control over the stack. That’s how you win in privacy tech.
