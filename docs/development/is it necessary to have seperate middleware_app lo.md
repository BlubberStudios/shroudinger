# is it necessary to have seperate middleware/app logic and backend?

TLDR:
For a native macOS DNS privacy app like "Shroudinger," you don’t need a traditional backend/middleware split like a web service. App logic and backend can be tightly integrated—unless you want remote services, multi-device sync, or enterprise features. Keep it simple and native for performance and security.

## Native macOS App: Do You Need Separate Middleware and Backend?

### 1. **Typical macOS App Architecture**

- **App Logic/Core Engine:** Handles DNS interception, blocklist management, encrypted DNS, and user settings—all running locally.
- **UI Layer:** Presents status, controls, and notifications to the user.
- **Backend (Traditional Definition):** Refers to remote servers or cloud services, not needed for most privacy apps unless you want to sync data or offload processing.


### 2. **When You Might Separate App Logic and Backend**

- **Cloud Blocklist Aggregation:** If you want to fetch, merge, or update blocklists from your own server (not just public URLs), you might run a backend service. The app would then pull updates from your backend.
- **User Accounts/Sync:** If you plan to offer account-based features, cross-device sync, or analytics, a backend becomes necessary.
- **Enterprise Features:** Centralized management, policy enforcement, or telemetry require a backend.


### 3. **When You Don’t Need a Separate Backend**

- **All-Local Processing:** If your app downloads blocklists directly from public sources (GitHub, etc.), parses and merges them locally, and does all DNS filtering on-device, there’s no need for a backend.
- **Privacy-First Design:** Minimizing external dependencies and keeping all logic on-device maximizes privacy and reduces attack surface.
- **Simplicity:** Fewer moving parts mean easier maintenance, faster updates, and less complexity.


### 4. **Recommended Structure for "Shroudinger"**

| Layer | Runs Where? | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| UI | On-device | Menu bar, settings, notifications |
| App Logic | On-device | DNS proxy, blocklist management, encrypted DNS |
| "Backend"* | On-device | (Optional) Blocklist update scheduler, background tasks |
| Remote Server | (Optional) Cloud | (Only if you want to host blocklists or offer sync) |

\* In this context, "backend" just means local background services, not a remote server.

## Bottom Line

- **Keep it local:** For a privacy-focused macOS app, integrate app logic and "backend" as a single, secure, on-device process.
- **Add a real backend only if:** You want cloud features, enterprise management, or remote blocklist hosting.
- **For most users:** A single, well-architected native app is simpler, faster, and more secure. That’s how you win trust—and market share.
