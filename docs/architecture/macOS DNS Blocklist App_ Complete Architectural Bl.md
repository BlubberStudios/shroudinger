# macOS DNS Blocklist App: Complete Architectural Blueprint

**TLDR:**
You're building a powerful privacy tool that intercepts DNS at the system level—think Little Snitch 6's encrypted DNS feature but with your own curated blocklists. This blueprint covers everything: Swift/SwiftUI frontend, NetworkExtension for system-level DNS interception, encrypted DNS protocols (DoT/DoH/DoQ), high-performance blocklist engines, and bulletproof system integration. Expect 18-20 weeks of development across 8 phases. The tech stack is modern Apple: Swift 5.9+, async/await, NEDNSProxyProvider, and Trie data structures for microsecond domain lookups. This isn't just an app—it's network infrastructure.

## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a multi-process architecture with clear separation of concerns, ensuring both security and performance. The system operates across three primary layers: user interface, application logic, and system-level network interception.

System Architecture Overview - macOS DNS Blocklist App

The architecture centers around **NEDNSProxyProvider**, Apple's sanctioned method for system-wide DNS interception. Unlike browser-level solutions, this approach captures all DNS traffic from every application on the system, providing comprehensive protection. The menu bar interface offers immediate access and real-time feedback, while the main application process handles configuration, blocklist management, and coordination with the network extension.

## Technology Stack and Frameworks

The technology foundation leverages Apple's latest frameworks and development tools, prioritizing performance, security, and native integration.

Technology Stack - macOS DNS Blocklist App

### Core Development Environment

- **Xcode 15+** with integrated Swift Package Manager
- **Swift 5.9+** featuring structured concurrency and modern language features
- **Instruments** for performance profiling and memory analysis
- **XCTest** and **XCUITest** for comprehensive testing coverage


### User Interface Layer

- **SwiftUI** for declarative, responsive interface design
- **MenuBarExtra** for seamless menu bar integration
- **AppKit** for native macOS controls and system integration
- **Combine** framework for reactive programming patterns


### Network and Security Layer

- **NetworkExtension** framework for system-level DNS interception
- **NEDNSProxyProvider** for DNS query processing
- **NWConnection** for encrypted DNS communications
- **Network.framework** for high-performance networking operations


## DNS Filtering Process Flow

The DNS filtering engine operates with microsecond precision, processing queries through a multi-stage pipeline designed for both speed and accuracy.

DNS Filtering Process Flow - macOS DNS Blocklist App

### Query Processing Pipeline

1. **DNS Query Interception**: All DNS queries are intercepted at the macOS network stack level
2. **Blocklist Evaluation**: Domain names are checked against optimized blocklist data structures
3. **Decision Engine**: Blocked domains receive immediate NXDOMAIN responses (~1ms)
4. **Encrypted Forwarding**: Allowed queries are forwarded to encrypted DNS servers (~5ms)
5. **Response Delivery**: DNS responses are returned through the same interception layer

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Performance optimization relies on carefully selected algorithms and data structures, each chosen for specific use cases within the DNS filtering pipeline.

### Key Performance Optimizations

**Blocklist Storage Strategy:**

- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Primary data structure for domain matching with O(m) lookup time
- **Hash Table**: Secondary exact-match lookups for performance-critical paths
- **Bloom Filter**: Initial filtering layer to reduce false positive searches

**Memory Management:**

- **LRU Cache**: Frequently accessed domains cached for sub-millisecond response
- **Object Pooling**: Reduces garbage collection pressure during high-throughput periods
- **Reference Counting**: Automatic memory management for Swift objects

**Network Performance:**

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient reuse of encrypted DNS connections
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failover during server unavailability
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent retry mechanisms for network resilience


## Development Phases and Timeline

The development process spans eight distinct phases, each with specific deliverables and success criteria.

### Phase Breakdown

**Phase 1-2 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation**
Project setup, architecture design, and core infrastructure development. Critical for establishing development velocity and technical foundation.

**Phase 3-4 (Weeks 3-8): Core Engine**
Network extension implementation and DNS encryption protocols. The most technically challenging phase requiring deep NetworkExtension expertise.

**Phase 5-6 (Weeks 9-12): Feature Development**
Blocklist system and user interface implementation. Focus shifts to user experience and performance optimization.

**Phase 7-8 (Weeks 13-18): Polish and Deployment**
Testing, optimization, and distribution preparation. Quality assurance and App Store compliance verification.

**Total Development Time: 94 days (18.8 weeks)**

## Critical Implementation Considerations

### System Extension Approval Process

Network extensions require explicit user approval through macOS System Preferences. The app must guide users through this process with clear instructions and error handling for approval failures.

### Entitlements and Sandboxing

- **Network Extension** entitlement required for DNS proxy functionality
- **App Sandbox** compatibility while maintaining network extension capabilities
- **Developer ID** signing for distribution outside the Mac App Store


### Performance Requirements

- **Sub-millisecond** blocklist lookups for real-time performance
- **Memory efficiency** to avoid impacting system performance
- **Network optimization** for encrypted DNS connections


### Security Considerations

- **Certificate validation** for encrypted DNS servers
- **DNSSEC support** for authenticated DNS responses
- **Privacy protection** ensuring no DNS query logging


## Advanced Features and Extensibility

### Custom Blocklist Management

- **Multi-format support**: Adblock Plus, hosts files, domain lists
- **Automatic updates**: Scheduled fetching from remote sources
- **User customization**: Whitelist management and custom rules
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time blocklist effectiveness metrics


### Encrypted DNS Protocols

- **DNS over TLS (DoT)**: Port 853 with TLS 1.3 encryption
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**: Port 443 with HTTP/2 transport
- **DNS over QUIC (DoQ)**: Port 853 with reduced connection overhead
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Automatic protocol switching for reliability

This architectural blueprint provides a comprehensive foundation for building a production-ready macOS DNS blocklist application. The modular design ensures maintainability while the performance optimizations guarantee enterprise-grade reliability. Each component has been selected for its proven track record in high-performance networking applications, creating a robust platform for DNS-based security and privacy protection.
