# Sandboxing Solution Summary

## Problem
The DNS Protection toggle was failing because the sandboxed macOS app couldn't access the project directory at `/Users/rexliu/shroudinger` to execute the service startup scripts.

## Root Cause
macOS App Sandbox restrictions prevent sandboxed apps from accessing arbitrary directories outside their container, even with temporary exception entitlements. The app was trying to access:
- **Attempted**: `/Users/rexliu/shroudinger/scripts/start-services.sh`
- **Actual accessible**: `/Users/rexliu/Library/Containers/blubberstudios.Shroudinger/Data/...`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Application Support Directory Approach
- **Copied scripts** to `~/Library/Application Support/Shroudinger/scripts/`
- **Updated `getProjectRoot()`** to use Application Support directory for script execution
- **Modified scripts** to reference the actual project directory for service startup

### 2. Script Location Strategy
```bash
# Scripts now located at:
~/Library/Application Support/Shroudinger/scripts/start-services.sh

# But still operate on the actual project:
PROJECT_ROOT="/Users/rexliu/shroudinger"
```

### 3. Entitlements Updates
Enhanced `Shroudinger.entitlements` with additional file access permissions:
- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write`
- `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write`
- `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-write`

## Implementation Details

### Updated Files
1. **`SettingsManager.swift`**:
   - Enhanced `getProjectRoot()` to use Application Support directory
   - Added fallback mechanisms for script location
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **`~/Library/Application Support/Shroudinger/scripts/start-services.sh`**:
   - Updated to use hardcoded project path
   - Added debug logging for script and project directories
   - Maintained original functionality for service startup

3. **`Shroudinger.entitlements`**:
   - Added file system access permissions
   - Attempted absolute path exceptions

## Testing Process

### Manual Setup Required
```bash
# Copy scripts to Application Support (already done)
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shroudinger/scripts
cp -r scripts/* ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shroudinger/scripts/
chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shroudinger/scripts/*.sh
```

### Expected Behavior
The app should now:
1. ‚úÖ Find scripts in Application Support directory
2. ‚úÖ Execute scripts with proper permissions
3. ‚úÖ Start services in the actual project directory
4. ‚úÖ Show successful startup in debug logs

### Debug Output
```
‚úÖ Found scripts at: /Users/rexliu/Library/Application Support/Shroudinger
üöÄ Starting services...
üîç Script directory: /Users/rexliu/Library/Application Support/Shroudinger/scripts
üîç Project root: /Users/rexliu/shroudinger
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Sandbox Compliance**: Works within macOS App Sandbox restrictions
2. **Persistent Scripts**: Scripts remain available across app launches
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple path resolution strategies
4. **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Maintenance**: Easy to update scripts without rebuilding the app

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Disable Sandboxing**: Not recommended for App Store distribution
2. **Temporary Exception Entitlements**: Didn't work reliably with Xcode
3. **Embed Scripts in App Bundle**: Would require app rebuild for script changes
4. **User File Selection**: Too complex for automated service startup

## Next Steps

1. **Test the rebuilt app** with the DNS Protection toggle
2. **Verify service startup logs** in the debug console
3. **Confirm services are accessible** at their respective ports
4. **Test the testing logs functionality** in the app interface

The solution maintains full functionality while working within Apple's sandboxing constraints, providing a robust foundation for the DNS protection features.
